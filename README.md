Project Description 

Project name: Living like a dragon

I really like Noségo's illustrations, his paintings are very dreamy, due to the fact that his subject matter is fluid and exists in a space that is both familiar and unfamiliar. He conveys an idea of inspiration in his paintings, which also infects the viewer and inspires them. In many of his paintings, he is revealing a love of life, where people need to go through highs, lows, successes, and failures to live this important life experience. And the dragon is a virtual creature created by Chinese culture and art, it symbolizes a spirit in China and is the totem of a nation. It is known to everyone as a good luck charm and it inspires people to face life with a positive attitude. No matter what joys or tribulations life may bring, it needs to be experienced and felt with the heart.

For this project, I used machine learning techniques to combine dragon and Noségo illustration styles by building datasets to create unique and visually appealing images that can also provide inspiration for human creativity. This project was used to explore the potential of machine learning in creating new and creative artwork.

There were several difficulties encountered during the implementation of the project, such as the compiler stalling and running out of memory after using larger images. I solved this by reducing the batch size, as well as reducing the image size, and the model size. I was able to improve the performance of the model by selecting appropriate hyperparameters.
